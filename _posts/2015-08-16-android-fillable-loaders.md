We usually don't like the internal drawing logic from the Android SDK too much. When we read about it 
we use to feel weird, as it seems to be a little bit tedious. But it is not that hard if you 
read it carefully, and if you are capable of understanding it properly, you will end up creating really 
interesting figures and animations like the following one:

![small-gif]

Isn't that cool?. The previous animation has been extracted from the [AndroidFillableLoaders library](https://github.com/JorgeCastilloPrz/AndroidFillableLoaders) 
which was published by me some days ago. The lib wants to create an interesting filling effect for a custom silhouette 
created by a given SVG Path, and it is totally open to be extended by the Android community. I will be 
using it for this code example.

# Parsing the SVG path

Standard SVG path formats are not understandable by the Android SDK out of the box, but you are always 
able to construct your own [Path](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/Path.html) 
item if you have a proper parser. 
If you take any PNG image with transparency, you will be able to export its SVG path in 
 standard format by using some available tools out there like **GIMP**. [Here](http://www.useragentman.com/blog/2013/04/26/how-to-create-svg-paths-easily-using-the-gimp/) 
you have a clear example of how to do it.

Once you have got the path, just copy the numbers that define it, which will look like the following:

```
M 2948.00,18.00
   C 2956.86,18.01 2954.31,18.45 2962.00,19.91
     3009.70,28.94 3043.56,69.15 3043.00,118.00
     3042.94,122.96 3042.06,127.15 3041.25,132.00
     3036.37,161.02 3020.92,184.46 2996.00,200.31
     2976.23,212.88 2959.60,214.26 2937.00,214.00
     2926.91,213.88 2912.06,209.70 2903.00,205.24
     2893.00,200.33 2884.08,194.74 2876.04,186.91
     2848.21,159.81 2839.19,115.93 2853.45,80.00
     2863.41,54.91 2883.01,35.57 2908.00,25.45
     2916.97,21.82 2924.84,20.75 2934.00,18.51
     2938.63,17.79 2943.32,17.99 2948.00,18.00 Z
   M 2870.76,78.00
   ...
```

This is the SVG Path that you will parse to convert it to a `Path` object which will be 
totally supported by the library. 

To parse it, i am using the 
[SvgPathParser](https://github.com/JorgeCastilloPrz/AndroidFillableLoaders/blob/master/library%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fgithub%2Fjorgecastillo%2Fsvg%2FSvgPathParser.java) 
class from [romannurik's Muzei](https://github.com/romannurik/muzei) code.
There is not so much to look at here, it is just a *"made by hand"* parser which converts standard path 
movements and directions defined by the String SVG path to movements in the `Path` item using its methods 
like `path.moveTo()`, `path.lineTo()`, or `path.cubicTo()` for *Bezier* curves.
 
If you know a little bit about SVG system, it defines some movements identifiable tags like `M` or `m` for 
linear movement, `C` or `c` for curves, `H` or `h` and `V` or `v` for horizontal or vertical lines, 
`L` or `l` for generic lines ...etc. Capital letters means absolutely positioned, lower cases means 
relatively positioned.

# Lifecycle statuses

`FillableLoader` is the main view here, and it has a limited number of statuses which will 
succeed one to another in order to get the complete animation working. Statuses are just flags 
that will tell the view how to get drawn at the current drawing cycle (`onDraw()` method).
At the same time, you should know that every animation from the composition (Dash / Filling) will have it's own 
duration, and that will let the View know when each step is finished, so it can change it's current 
status to the following one.
 
The `drawingState` list for the view is going to be:

* `NOT_STARTED`: This is the beginning one.
* `TRACE_STARTED`: The silhouette (dash, stroke, trace) is being drawn.
* `FILL_STARTED`: Trace got completed and now we are filling the view.
* `FINISHED`: This is obviously the final state of the view.

Every time the view switches it's state, the `OnStateChangeListener` method will be called to give external 
feedback to the used in order to let him create proper reactions to the animation.

# Dash drawing

Once the view gets into it's `TRACE_STARTED` state, the surrounding dash will get drawn. I have a 
`Paint` initialized for that:

```java
dashPaint = new Paint();
    dashPaint.setStyle(Paint.Style.STROKE);
    dashPaint.setAntiAlias(true);
    dashPaint.setStrokeWidth(strokeWidth);
    dashPaint.setColor(strokeColor);
```

Everything is pretty normal. But how to draw the dash? If you think about it, we will need to draw a little 
bit more of the line in every cycle. So the line will keep growing, and the space still not drawn will decrease. 

There is one method that will come really handy to us in the Android SDK to get this effect done. The `dashPaint.setPathEffect(new DashPathEffect(...)))` method. As its documentation says, the `DashPathEffect` will need to get an array of intervals in its constructor which must have an even number of items. The even indices of the array will specify the "on" intervals, and the odd indices specifying the "off" intervals. The second argument will be a phase value which will be used as an offset into the array, but which we will not be using for this library.

**Note:** this patheffect only affects drawing with the paint's style set to `STROKE` or `FILL_AND_STROKE`. It is ignored if the drawing is done with style == `FILL`.

But we are missing something here, right? The length of the dash for the current cycle that needs to get drawn. The complete code would be (into the `onDraw()` method):

```java
float phase 
    = MathUtil.constrain(0, 1, elapsedTime * 1f / strokeDuration);
float distance = animInterpolator.getInterpolation(phase) 
    * pathData.length;

dashPaint.setPathEffect(
    new DashPathEffect(new float[] { distance, pathData.length }, 0));
    
canvas.drawPath(pathData.path, dashPaint);
```

We will get the current percent of the total time of the "animation" and the distance of the line to get drawn will be obtained from it, using an interpolator (a `DecelerateInterpolator`) as a base for the values. The `pathData.length` has been obtained previously using the [PathMeasure](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/PathMeasure.html) class.

So here it is, we already have our dash effect getting drawn. See [FillableLoader class](https://github.com/JorgeCastilloPrz/AndroidFillableLoaders/blob/master/library%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fgithub%2Fjorgecastillo%2FFillableLoader.java) for more detailed info. Now lets keep moving!

# Filling Drawing

Again, i have a paint ready for this matter. This time is just  a common filling paint:

```java
fillPaint = new Paint();
    fillPaint.setAntiAlias(true);
    fillPaint.setStyle(Paint.Style.FILL);
    fillPaint.setColor(fillColor);
```

So the drawing code will look like this (into the `onDraw()` method):

```java
float fillPhase = 
    MathUtil.constrain(0, 1, 
    (elapsedTime - strokeDuration) * 1f / fillDuration);
    
clippingTransform.transform(canvas, fillPhase, this);
canvas.drawPath(pathData.path, fillPaint);
```

As you can see, the time phase will be the percent of time consumed for filling drawing until this very moment. To calculate that we must substract the `strokeDuration` as it was used for the stroke (dash) animation.

The clipping logic will be delegated into a [ClippingTransform](https://github.com/JorgeCastilloPrz/AndroidFillableLoaders/blob/master/library%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fgithub%2Fjorgecastillo%2Fclippingtransforms%2FClippingTransform.java) 
implementation and the logic in charge to create the filling effect would reside into it's `transform()` method.
The only secret here is to think about clipping forms. If we have a figure that is getting drawn by a filling 
paint (and limited by the path bounds), we would want to get a clipping figure attached to the canvas before the filling figure is drawn, so the filling gets clipped by the form we have used.

To understand this, i will use two examples.

## SpikesClippingTransform

This will be the first sample, as it is the easier one too. The `transform()` method for this custom `ClippingTransform` would look like:

```java
@Override public void transform(Canvas canvas, float currentFillPhase, View view) {
    cacheDimensions(view.getWidth(), view.getHeight());
    buildClippingPath();
    spikesPath.offset(0, height * -currentFillPhase);
    canvas.clipPath(spikesPath, Region.Op.DIFFERENCE);
}
```

Ignore the `cacheDimensions()` method, as it is only used to store view dimensions in memory at first, and just once. The important stuff here is in the last three lines. The method `buildClippingPath()` will setup the `spikesPath` with the path we need to draw a figure with spikes border. I will give you a graphic example:

![spikes-gif]

Once the spikes path is created, we give it an `Y` dimension offset that will change depending on the `currentFillPhase` 
percent and the view height, so in every `onDraw()` call it will get shifted a little bit more to the top.
 That is done in the following line from the above snippet:

```java
spikesPath.offset(0, height * -currentFillPhase);
```

At the end, the `canvas.clipPath()` method will be used to set the clipping path to the created and 
positioned `spikesPath`, and we will use a `DIFFERENCE` operation between regions approach. 

```java
canvas.clipPath(spikesPath, Region.Op.DIFFERENCE);
```

It is totally optional, since you could create your `ClippingTransform` implementation based into another 
operations, like the default one, which is `INTERSECT` (See [Region.Op documentation](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/graphics/Region.Op.html) for more details).

But, how to draw the spikes path? Here we are:

```java
private void buildClippingPath() {
    float heightDiff = width * 1f / 32;
    float widthDiff = width * 1f / 32;
    float startingHeight = height - heightDiff;

    spikesPath.moveTo(0, startingHeight);

    float nextX = widthDiff;
    float nextY = startingHeight + heightDiff;

    for (int i = 0; i < 32; i++) {
      spikesPath.lineTo(nextX, nextY);
      nextX += widthDiff;
      nextY += (i % 2 == 0) ? heightDiff : -heightDiff;
    }

    spikesPath.lineTo(width, 0);
    spikesPath.lineTo(0, 0);
    spikesPath.close();
  }
```

Dont be afraid about it. If you analyze it you will see that i am just using a constant `withDiff` value to shift in X axis between each spike, and a `heightDiff` value to be used as a positive/negative shift alternation in order to move the next Y coordinate and create the spikes.

So here we have the first sample working! Feel free to check the full [SpikesClippingTransform](https://github.com/JorgeCastilloPrz/AndroidFillableLoaders/blob/master/library%2Fsrc%2Fmain%2Fjava%2Fcom%2Fgithub%2Fjorgecastillo%2Fclippingtransforms%2FSpikesClippingTransform.java) class out if you want more details about it!

## WavesClippingTransform

The `transform()` method for this one will look exactly like the one from the previous sample, so i am not copying it here again. We will focus in the path building, as it is the most interesting stuff here.

I have 128 different wave batches propagated over the time so i can rotate over them:

```java
private void buildClippingPath() {
    buildWaveAtIndex(currentWaveBatch++ % 128, 128);
}
```

128 is just an arbitrary number, and the more wave batches you add to the loop, the slower will become the total animation. Think about them as frames of a standard animation (it is what they really are at a concept level). So the `index` argument of the following method will change for every `onDraw()` call. The batches will contain four waves each, and those waves contained will vary its `X` axis position and `Y` variation depending on the `currentWaveBatch` index.

```java
private void buildWaveAtIndex(int index, int waveCount) {
    float startingHeight = height - 20;
    boolean initialOrLast = (index == 1 || index == waveCount);

    float xMovement = (width * 1f / waveCount) * index;
    float divisions = 8;
    float variation = 10;

    wavesPath.moveTo(-width, startingHeight);

    // First wave
    if (!initialOrLast) {
      variation = randomFloat();
    }

    wavesPath.quadTo(-width + width * 1f / divisions + xMovement, 
                    startingHeight + variation, 
                    -width + width * 1f / 4 + xMovement, 
                    startingHeight);

    if (!initialOrLast) {
      variation = randomFloat();
    }

    wavesPath.quadTo(-width + width * 1f / divisions * 3 + xMovement, 
                    startingHeight - variation,
                    -width + width * 1f / 2 + xMovement, 
                    startingHeight);

    // Second wave
    if (!initialOrLast) {
      variation = randomFloat();
    }

    wavesPath.quadTo(-width + width * 1f / divisions * 5 + xMovement, 
                    startingHeight + variation,
                    -width + width * 1f / 4 * 3 + xMovement,
                     startingHeight);

    if (!initialOrLast) {
      variation = randomFloat();
    }

    wavesPath.quadTo(-width + width * 1f / divisions * 7 + xMovement,
                    startingHeight - variation, 
                    -width + width + xMovement, 
                    startingHeight);

    // Third wave
    if (!initialOrLast) {
      variation = randomFloat();
    }

    wavesPath.quadTo(width * 1f / divisions + xMovement, 
                    startingHeight + variation, 
                    width * 1f / 4 + xMovement,
                    startingHeight);

    if (!initialOrLast) {
      variation = randomFloat();
    }

    wavesPath.quadTo(width * 1f / divisions * 3 + xMovement, 
                    startingHeight - variation, 
                    width * 1f / 2 + xMovement, 
                    startingHeight);

    // Forth wave
    if (!initialOrLast) {
      variation = randomFloat();
    }

    wavesPath.quadTo(width * 1f / divisions * 5 + xMovement, 
                    startingHeight + variation, 
                    width * 1f / 4 * 3 + xMovement, 
                    startingHeight);

    if (!initialOrLast) {
      variation = randomFloat();
    }

    wavesPath.quadTo(width * 1f / divisions * 7 + xMovement, 
                    startingHeight - variation,
                    width + xMovement, 
                    startingHeight);

    // Closing path
    wavesPath.lineTo(width + 100, startingHeight);
    wavesPath.lineTo(width + 100, 0);
    wavesPath.lineTo(0, 0);
    wavesPath.close();
}

private float randomFloat() {
    return nextFloat(10) + height * 1f / 25;
}

private float nextFloat(float upperBound) {
    Random random = new Random();
    return (Math.abs(random.nextFloat()) % (upperBound + 1));
}
```

As i said, there are 4 waves being drawn for every wave batch constructed by the above method. The `xMovement` var is pretty explicit, as it handles the movement shifting over the `X` axis. The waves are getting drawn using the `path.quatTo()` method, which draws a quadratic *Bezier* courve starting at the current point of the path, using the first given point (X,Y coordinates) as a control point, and ending into the last given point coordinates. 

```java
path.quadTo(controlPointX, controlPointY, endPointX, endPointY)
```

![bez-curve]

The variation will be random, and applied to the control point `Y` coordinate with an alternate sign for each one of the waves, so we can get the concave / convex alternation. The `divisions` are 8 (half a wave) to know where to start every wave.

It can feel a little bit tedious to understand at the beginning, but i hope you can get a clear idea of how to get theese sort of clipping path figures / animations working. Here is a sample of the final result for the wave effect:
