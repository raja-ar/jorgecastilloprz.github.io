title: About me
---

About five years ago i got the chance to get my first Android device. Since that very moment i have been 
doing the same stuff. I have been involved in a constant battle to get better, based on motivation and 
real interest for what i love to do. To create whole new apps / libraries from the scratch until its very 
final form.

I really like the full development process of a project and to be involved in nice environments to get 
the work done. Developers are ambitious, so learning from each other is the best chance to improve we have. 
And the spanish community is pretty good, i have to say.
 
 
# Android apps

I have been part of plenty of interesting Android projects in my professional career. Here are some examples:
*  I got involved in a **XMPP protocol based chat with a secret side** secured behind a blocking pattern (very similar to *Telegram*). Even if it is not available at the Google Play Store anymore, you can get a sneak peak from the app [here](http://www.droiders.com/es/tag/enjoystr-es/). 
* I had the chance to work on tons of geolocation based apps, like the experimental project called [Nativo](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.droiders.android.nativovanilla) which displayed near places of interesent around you using augmented reality. This project was mainly created for Google Glass, but an early version was created too for mobile. 
* I worked in countless `GLASS` applications too, as in `Android Wear` apps.
* I worked in a lot of personal projects and so many application projects for third party companies.


# Android / Java Open Source libraries

I learned a lot from the Open Source scene, and that is the main reason for me to try to contribute as much as i can on it. I have created some Open Source projects and libraries. You can check [my Gihub profile](https://github.com/JorgeCastilloPrz/) for some examples, but i will talk a little bit about some of them:

* [Corleone](https://github.com/JorgeCastilloPrz/Corleone) is an **Annotation processor** library that provides an annotation based implementation to work with contactenated background tasks. This project is similar to the very well known `Path` `PriorityJobQueue` but working with annotations and autogenerated code.
* [AndroidFillableLoaders](https://github.com/JorgeCastilloPrz/AndroidFillableLoaders): Custom component to create interesting brand logos for your apps or loaders that can get filled with nice effects. **It is working through SVG Paths**. You have a detailed post about its functionality [here](http://jorgecastillo.xyz/2015/08/16/android-fillable-loaders/)
* [FABProgressCircle](https://github.com/JorgeCastilloPrz/FABProgressCircle): This one is a custom view that replicates a [**Google** material design approach](https://material-design.storage.googleapis.com/publish/material_v_4/material_ext_publish/0B6Okdz75tqQsa0QwVnd6NVlvWkk/components-progressactivity-typesofindicators-Circular_wFab_xhdpi_003.webm) to create a progress circle around any FloatingActionButton library.
* [PagedHeadListView](https://github.com/JorgeCastilloPrz/PagedHeadListView): This one is a little bit old, so it is based in the `ListView` android component. It is a `ListView` wrapper with an interesting custom indicator and a paginated header.
* [ExpandablePanel](https://github.com/JorgeCastilloPrz/ExpandablePanel): Library that provides an expandable through gestures panel with some different configurations.
* [Mirage](https://github.com/JorgeCastilloPrz/Mirage) is a prototype of an app that is still being created on my free time. It is a geolocation based app for excursionists displaying plenty of interesting nature places around.
* [Dagger2Scopes](https://github.com/JorgeCastilloPrz/Dagger2Scopes) was an early simple example of `Dagger 2` scoping working through components. It is not finished and i am planning to revamp it totally to provide an advance working code sample.
* [ScalaForTheImpatient](https://github.com/JorgeCastilloPrz/ScalaForTheImpatient) is a `Scala` functional language project where i am solving all the exercises proposed by the [ScalaForTheImpatient](http://www.horstmann.com/scala/index.html) book.
# Android games

I got the chance to work in a game development company where we created games composed totally by custom 
views and custom animations. Those were sport manager games where we had more than a million users. It 
was an interesting challenge. Here are some examples:

* [Fantasy Manager Football 2015](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fromthebenchgames.fmfootball2015) is a football manager game with tons of official licenses and versions for important european clubs. We created all the binaries using gradle `flavor` system. You can check for some of the different football games we created [here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/dev?id=4682432532609369869).
* [NBA General Manager 2015](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fromthebenchgames.nbamanager15) is one of the official NBA licensed games with more than a million users.
* [Football Franchise 2015](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fromthebenchgames.nflpamanager14) is an NFL manager game based in the oficial NFL.
* [Baseball General Manager 2015](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fromthebenchgames.mlbpamanager14) is a baseball manager game based in the oficial Major League Baseball.
